# MITRE ATT&CK Mappings
A public repository of my mapping of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for OSINT reports that lack a section breaking down the TTPs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These MITRE ATT&CK mappings are my human interpretation and analysis of TTPs from reports I have read. As with anything human-created, it is prone to human error. This is a free resource and I accept Pull Requests for any that wants to add or edit TTPs.
